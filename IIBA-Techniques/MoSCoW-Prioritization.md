# MoSCoW Prioritization Technique
*IIBA Technique: Prioritization*

## Methodology
**M - MUST HAVE**
- Fundamental to project success
- Without these, solution won't work
- Maximum 60% of total requirements

**S - SHOULD HAVE**
- Important but not vital
- Could be delayed but would impact value
- 20-40% of total requirements

**C - COULD HAVE**
- Desirable but less important
- Can be easily left out
- 10-20% of total requirements

**W - WON'T HAVE**
- Not in current scope
- May be included in future phases

## Implementation Template
| Requirement ID | Description | MoSCoW | Business Value | Effort | Dependencies |
|---------------|-------------|--------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| REQ-001 | User authentication | MUST | 10 | Medium | None |
| REQ-002 | Advanced reporting | SHOULD | 8 | High | REQ-001 |

## Rules for Application
1. **Timeboxing**: Must-haves must be deliverable within time constraints
2. **Collaboration**: Prioritization done with stakeholders, not for them
3. **Validation**: Regularly review and adjust priorities
4. **Communication**: Clear rationale for each prioritization decision
